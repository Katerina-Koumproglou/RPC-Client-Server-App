# RPC Client-Server Application
This project is an implementation of a simple RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Client-Server system using rpcgen. The client sends a vector Y (with size n) and a float a to the server, and the server performs different computations on Y. While using a menu, it provides three remote procedures:

1. Compute the average of an array of integers.
2. Find the minimum and maximum values in the array.
3. Multiply each element of the array with a float value.
4. Exit

The messages are in Greek and there are screenshots below showcasing the outputs.
